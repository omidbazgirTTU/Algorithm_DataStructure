    Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come
    before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come
    after it (equal values can go either way).
    After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.

    Samples:
    >>> a = [2, 3, 9, 2, 2]
    >>> partition2(a, 0, 4)
    2

def partition3(a, left, right):
    """3-way partitioning.

    This method is useful when array contains lot of duplicate values which is
    very frequent in real world. Idea is to divide array in three parts rather
    than two. First part contains all numbers which are less than the pivot,
    second part contains number equal to the pivot and last part contains
    numbers which are greater than pivot.

    Samples:
    >>> a = [2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1]
